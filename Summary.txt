Image Encryption Process :  is the process of transforming data using an algorithm or a mathematical 
function to make it unreadable to anyone except  the intended receiver who knows the private key.
 
Image  encryption  techniques  try  to  convert  an  image  to  another  image  that  is  hard  to  understand ,
to  keep  the image  confidential  between  users , that means nobody  could know the content of an Image without a key for decryption.


The key-generation process is as the following :

1- Select a large prime p and a positive integer r such that r  is a primitive root of p.
2- Select a positive integer a such that  1< a ≤ p.
3- Compute  s ≡(r)^a (mod p).
4- Let the public-key  be announced publicly). →(r, s, p).
5- Let the private key be kept secret →(a).


The encryption process Algorithm is as the following :
Step1: start .

Step2:Read the plain image into its corresponding  matrix (call it M ) using MATLAB such that 
each element m[i][j] in M does not exceed the prime number p.

Step3 : Let the public key (r, s, p) .

Step 4: For all the element m[i][j] in the matrix,  select one random integer k  with , 1≤ k ≤p-2 . 

Step 5: Compute X ≡ r^k (mod p). 

Step  6: Compute y[i][j] ≡ (m[i][j]* s^k) (mod p)

Step 7: Show the encrypted image Y .


Now,  after reading  the  encrypted  image,the matrix of the  encrypted image can be sent as Y.
In  addition,  the sender  has  to  send  X  with  Y  to the receiver.
Once the encrypted image reaches the destination, it must be decrypted .


The Image Decryption process Algorithm as the following :

Step1: Import to data (Y) from the encrypted image .

Step 2: Restore the plain image M,such that M ≡ [ Y ((X)^a)^-1] (mod p)  

Step3: Obtain the original image (decrypted image).
